- ## 7:00–9:00 AM: Wake-Up + Decompression Block
- ### 1. Diaphragm + Ribcage Reset (30 min)
- 90/90 Supine Breathing with Heels Pressed into Wall (3 sets x 5 min)
- _Left hand on left ribs, feel expansion. Exhale fully with tongue to roof._
- Add slight posterior tilt during exhale (flatten lower back)
  
  > [!tip]- **90/90 SUPINE BREATHING **
  > 
  > ### 🎯 **Purpose**
  > - Enhance **diaphragmatic breathing**: Promotes use of the diaphragm over accessory muscles.  
  > - Improve **ribcage mobility**: Enables better expansion/contraction of the ribs.  
  > - Support **posterior pelvic tilt**: Activates hamstrings for neutral pelvis positioning.  
  > - Activate **core musculature**: Engages transverse abdominis and obliques.
  >
  > ### 🔧 **Execution**
  > **Setup:**
  > - Lie on your back, hips & knees at 90°, feet flat on a wall.
  > - Place a small ball or pillow between knees.
  > - Left hand on lower left ribs (to monitor rib movement).
  >
  > **Breathing Technique:**
  > - **Inhale** through nose: Fill lower ribs & abdomen — feel left hand rise slightly.
  > - **Exhale** fully through mouth: Tongue on roof, press heels into wall, slight posterior pelvic tilt (flatten lower back).
  > - **Pause** briefly before next inhale.
  >
  > **Repetitions:** 3 sets × 5 minutes (slow, controlled breaths).
  >
  > ###  **Sensations to Monitor**
  > - Inhalation: Rib & belly expansion, minimal chest rise.  
  > - Exhalation: Ab activation, lower back flattening, hamstring tension (via heel press).
  >
  > ###  **Common Mistakes**
  > - Overarching lower back (keep it flat).
  > - Lifting chest/shoulders (avoid accessory muscle dominance).
  > - Holding breath — maintain smooth rhythm.
  >
  > ###  **Mental Cues**
  > - “Breathe into your belt line.”  
  > - “Expand ribs sideways like an accordion.”  
  > - “Exhale fully, ribs draw down and in.”
  >
  > ###  **When to Incorporate**
  > - **Warm-up** (preps diaphragm & core)  
  > - **Cool-down** (parasympathetic activation)  
  > - **Rehab** (breathing/postural dysfunction recovery)
  >
  > ### **Demo Videos**
  > - *90/90 Supine Breathing*: Basic setup & technique https://youtu.be/WEqcbzeQdnA?si=R1_vL5t6vN7TjS7H
  > - *3 Minute Ribcage Reset*: Rib mobility & breath mechanics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilUiFx4LZyI.  
  > - *Full Diaphragm Breathing – Lower Ribs*: Emphasis on lower rib expansion https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuPAiew9ZHg.
- ### 2. Posterior Expansion Drills (30 min)
- Quadruped "Bear Breathing" (on all fours, hips back slightly)
- Long exhale (6–8s), fully empty
- Use mirror → watch lower back widen on inhale
  
  > [!tip]-  **QUADRUPED POSTERIOR RIB EXPANSION **
  > 
  > ###  **Purpose**
  > - Enhance **posterior ribcage expansion**: Direct airflow into back of ribs.  
  > - Promote **diaphragmatic breathing**: Prioritize diaphragm over accessory muscles.  
  > - Improve **thoracic mobility**: Mobilize the upper back region.  
  > - Engage **core musculature**: Activate deep stabilizing core muscles.
  >
  > ###  **Execution**
  > **Starting Position:**
  > - Begin in **quadruped** (all fours): hands under shoulders, knees under hips.  
  > - Slightly **rock hips back** toward heels while maintaining a neutral spine — “bear position.”
  >
  > **Breathing Technique:**
  > - **Inhale** slowly through your nose into your **lower back** and lateral ribs.  
  > - **Exhale** fully over 6–8 sec through your mouth; maintain a slight posterior pelvic tilt.  
  > - Brief **pause** after exhalation before next breath.
  >
  > **Repetitions:** 3 sets × 5 minutes (slow, deliberate breathing).
  >
  > ### **Sensations to Monitor**
  > - Inhale: Expansion in lower back and side ribs, minimal chest lift.  
  > - Exhale: Abdominal engagement, ribcage descending inward and downward.
  >
  > ### **Common Mistakes**
  > - **Overarching lower back** — maintain a neutral spinal curve.  
  > - **Chest breathing** — avoid accessory muscle recruitment.  
  > - **Breath holding** — keep breathing smooth and uninterrupted.
  >
  > ### **Mental Cues**
  > - “Breathe into your lower back.”  
  > - “Ribs expand sideways like an accordion.”  
  > - “Exhale fully — ribs draw down and in.”
  >
  > ###  **When to Incorporate**
  > - **Warm-up** — primes diaphragm, core, and ribcage mechanics.  
  > - **Cool-down** — shifts nervous system into parasympathetic recovery.  
  > - **Rehab** — ideal for postural imbalance or breathing retraining.

  > ---
  > 
  > ### **Execution**
  > 
  > 1. **Setup**:
  >     
  >     - Sit on the floor with your front leg bent at 90 degrees (knee in line with hip) and your back leg also bent at 90 degrees behind you.
  >         
  >     - Ensure both sit bones are grounded, and maintain an upright posture.
  >         
  > 2. **Passive Stretch**:
  >     
  >     - Lean forward over your front leg, keeping your spine neutral.
  >         
  >     - Hold this position for 2 minutes, breathing deeply to allow the tissues to relax.[[P]rehab](https://library.theprehabguys.com/vimeo-video/frc-principle-pails-rails/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  >         
  > 3. **PAILs (Progressive Angular Isometric Loading)**:
  >     
  >     - After the passive stretch, begin to gently press your front leg and foot into the ground, as if trying to lift yourself up without actually moving.
  >         
  >     - Gradually increase the intensity of this contraction over 10 seconds, reaching up to 100% effort.
  >         
  >     - Hold this maximal contraction for 10 seconds.[[P]rehab](https://library.theprehabguys.com/vimeo-video/frc-principle-pails-rails/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  >         
  > 4. **RAILs (Regressive Angular Isometric Loading)**:
  >     
  >     - Immediately after the PAILs contraction, attempt to lift your front leg and foot off the ground, engaging the muscles on the opposite side.
  >         
  >     - Again, ramp up the intensity over 10 seconds to a maximal effort.
  >         
  >     - Hold this contraction for 10 seconds.
  >         
  > 5. **Repetitions**:
  >     
  >     - Perform 3 rounds per side, with a brief rest between rounds.
  >         
  >     - Given your emphasis on the left side, consider adding an extra round or increasing the intensity slightly on that side.
  >         
  > 
  > ---
  > 
  > ### **Sensations to Monitor**
  > 
  > - **During Passive Stretch**: A gentle stretch in the hip region, without pain.
  >     
  > - **During PAILs**: Intense contraction in the muscles being stretched.
  >     
  > - **During RAILs**: Strong engagement in the muscles opposite to those being stretched.
  >     
  > 
  > ---
  > 
  > ### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
  > 
  > - **Overarching the lower back**: Maintain a neutral spine throughout.
  >     
  > - **Allowing the back leg to collapse**: Keep both legs actively engaged.
  >     
  > - **Holding breath**: Ensure continuous, deep breathing to facilitate muscle engagement and relaxation.
  >     
  > 
  > ---
  > 
  > ### **Mental Cues**

- ## Daily Principles:
- **Every movement = opportunity for left-side activation**
- Every breath = postural decompression
- Avoid overexertion — this is **neuroplastic rewiring**, not punishment


<!-- anchor: plansweek2 -->
# PLANS/WEEK2

<!-- path: PLANS/WEEK2.md -->

## Phase 2 Overview

This phase **reprograms core asymmetries**, **locks in left-side loading**, and **inhibits dominant right-side overactivity** through:

> - **Left scapular depression control**
>     
> - **Right leg inhibition drills**
>     
> - **Split-stance breathing (left bias)**
>     
> - **Sensorimotor cue resets**
>     
> - **Controlled skipping/running with breath pacing**
>     

We shift from _pure decompression_ (Phase 1) → into _neuromuscular asymmetry correction and functional loading_ — without compromising reset gains.

## Phase 2: 10-Hour Full-Day Plan (Days 8–14)

> Assumes you’ve cleared Phase 1 mobility & breath tolerance — ready to layer activation safely

## How It Works — Strategically

|Layer|Outcome|
|---|---|
|Left-side scap/glute training|Rebuilds _torso-pelvis symmetry_|
|Right-side inhibition|Breaks old CNS movement dominance loops|
|Gait-phase + breath syncing|Restores _neuromechanical rhythm_ across kinetic chains|
|Sensorimotor cue stacking|Reprograms proprioception for long-term central axis balance|
|Tapered evening downshift|Ends the day in **parasympathetic** → accelerates nervous system reset|

---

## Results Expected by End of Phase 2:

- **Visible gait symmetry increase**
    
- **Breathing becoming more even**
    
- **Right stiffness reduction**
    
- **Left glute, hamstring, scapular function visibly re-activating**
    
- **Improved sleep-depth and circadian realignment**
