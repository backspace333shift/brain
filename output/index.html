Cueing</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Position:</strong> Lie on your left side on a comfortable surface.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Stack your hips and shoulders vertically.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Knees:</strong> Bend your knees at approximately 90 degrees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Head Support:</strong> Use a pillow or your left arm to support your head, maintaining neck alignment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hand Placement:</strong> Place your right hand on your right lower ribs to provide tactile feedback during breathing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Execution:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inhalation:</strong> Inhale slowly through your nose, focusing on directing the breath into your right ribcage and oblique area, feeling the expansion under your right hand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exhalation:</strong> Exhale gently through pursed lips, allowing the ribs to return to their resting position.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Repetitions:</strong> Complete 4 sets of 6 breaths.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sensory Feedback:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Right Ribcage:</strong> Noticeable lateral expansion during inhalation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Right Obliques:</strong> Engagement during exhalation, assisting in ribcage compression.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Common Pitfalls:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shoulder Rolling Forward:</strong> Ensure your right shoulder remains stacked above the left to prevent torso rotation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Shallow Breathing:</strong> Focus on deep, diaphragmatic breaths rather than chest breathing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Neck Strain:</strong> Support your head adequately to maintain a neutral neck position.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Video Demonstration:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkr2_Dj0Jmo\">Side-Lying
