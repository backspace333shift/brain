## Phase 2 Overview

This phase **reprograms core asymmetries**, **locks in left-side loading**, and **inhibits dominant right-side overactivity** through:

> - **Left scapular depression control**
>     
> - **Right leg inhibition drills**
>     
> - **Split-stance breathing (left bias)**
>     
> - **Sensorimotor cue resets**
>     
> - **Controlled skipping/running with breath pacing**
>     

We shift from _pure decompression_ (Phase 1) → into _neuromuscular asymmetry correction and functional loading_ — without compromising reset gains.

## Phase 2: 10-Hour Full-Day Plan (Days 8–14)

> Assumes you’ve cleared Phase 1 mobility & breath tolerance — ready to layer activation safely

## How It Works — Strategically

|Layer|Outcome|
|---|---|
|Left-side scap/glute training|Rebuilds _torso-pelvis symmetry_|
|Right-side inhibition|Breaks old CNS movement dominance loops|
|Gait-phase + breath syncing|Restores _neuromechanical rhythm_ across kinetic chains|
|Sensorimotor cue stacking|Reprograms proprioception for long-term central axis balance|
|Tapered evening downshift|Ends the day in **parasympathetic** → accelerates nervous system reset|

---

## Results Expected by End of Phase 2:

- **Visible gait symmetry increase**
    
- **Breathing becoming more even**
    
- **Right stiffness reduction**
    
- **Left glute, hamstring, scapular function visibly re-activating**
    
- **Improved sleep-depth and circadian realignment**
