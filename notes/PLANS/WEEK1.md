## Phase 1 Overview:

|Goal|Mechanism|
|---|---|
|Ribcage decompression|Restore 3D breathing and reduce internal pressure|
|Left side reactivation|Activate left obliques, hamstring, adductor to pull pelvis/rib into alignment|
|Right side inhibition|Shut off overactive right QL/glute/SCM|
|Vagal nerve reset|Switch from fight/flight to rest/digest recovery state|
|Repattern breath → spine → pelvis stack|Make posture self-maintaining, not willpower-based|

- ## 7:00–9:00 AM: Wake-Up + Decompression Block
- ### 1. Diaphragm + Ribcage Reset (30 min)
- 90/90 Supine Breathing with Heels Pressed into Wall (3 sets x 5 min)
- _Left hand on left ribs, feel expansion. Exhale fully with tongue to roof._
- Add slight posterior tilt during exhale (flatten lower back)
  
  > [!tip]- **90/90 SUPINE BREATHING **
  > 
  > ### 🎯 **Purpose**
  > - Enhance **diaphragmatic breathing**: Promotes use of the diaphragm over accessory muscles.  
  > - Improve **ribcage mobility**: Enables better expansion/contraction of the ribs.  
  > - Support **posterior pelvic tilt**: Activates hamstrings for neutral pelvis positioning.  
  > - Activate **core musculature**: Engages transverse abdominis and obliques.
  >
  > ### 🔧 **Execution**
  > **Setup:**
  > - Lie on your back, hips & knees at 90°, feet flat on a wall.
  > - Place a small ball or pillow between knees.
  > - Left hand on lower left ribs (to monitor rib movement).
  >
  > **Breathing Technique:**
  > - **Inhale** through nose: Fill lower ribs & abdomen — feel left hand rise slightly.
  > - **Exhale** fully through mouth: Tongue on roof, press heels into wall, slight posterior pelvic tilt (flatten lower back).
  > - **Pause** briefly before next inhale.
  >
  > **Repetitions:** 3 sets × 5 minutes (slow, controlled breaths).
  >
  > ###  **Sensations to Monitor**
  > - Inhalation: Rib & belly expansion, minimal chest rise.  
  > - Exhalation: Ab activation, lower back flattening, hamstring tension (via heel press).
  >
  > ###  **Common Mistakes**
  > - Overarching lower back (keep it flat).
  > - Lifting chest/shoulders (avoid accessory muscle dominance).
  > - Holding breath — maintain smooth rhythm.
  >
  > ###  **Mental Cues**
  > - “Breathe into your belt line.”  
  > - “Expand ribs sideways like an accordion.”  
  > - “Exhale fully, ribs draw down and in.”
  >
  > ###  **When to Incorporate**
  > - **Warm-up** (preps diaphragm & core)  
  > - **Cool-down** (parasympathetic activation)  
  > - **Rehab** (breathing/postural dysfunction recovery)
  >
  > ### **Demo Videos**

  >
  > **Breathing Technique:**
  > - **Inhale** slowly through your nose into your **lower back** and lateral ribs.  
  > - **Exhale** fully over 6–8 sec through your mouth; maintain a slight posterior pelvic tilt.  
  > - Brief **pause** after exhalation before next breath.
  >
  > **Repetitions:** 3 sets × 5 minutes (slow, deliberate breathing).
  >
  > ### **Sensations to Monitor**
  > - Inhale: Expansion in lower back and side ribs, minimal chest lift.  
  > - Exhale: Abdominal engagement, ribcage descending inward and downward.
  >
  > ### **Common Mistakes**
  > - **Overarching lower back** — maintain a neutral spinal curve.  
  > - **Chest breathing** — avoid accessory muscle recruitment.  
  > - **Breath holding** — keep breathing smooth and uninterrupted.
  >
  > ### **Mental Cues**
  > - “Breathe into your lower back.”  
  > - “Ribs expand sideways like an accordion.”  
  > - “Exhale fully — ribs draw down and in.”
  >
  > ###  **When to Incorporate**
  > - **Warm-up** — primes diaphragm, core, and ribcage mechanics.  
  > - **Cool-down** — shifts nervous system into parasympathetic recovery.  
  > - **Rehab** — ideal for postural imbalance or breathing retraining.

- ### 13. Deep Exhale Drills + Vagus Stim (30 min)
- Humming + Long 8–10s exhale
- Chin slightly down
- Tap over left rib, temple, neck while exhaling
  > [!tip]- **deeph exhales**
  >The vagus nerve is a key component of the parasympathetic nervous system, which governs the body's "rest and digest" functions. Stimulating this nerve can lead to decreased heart rate, lower blood pressure, and a sense of calm. Techniques like humming, deep breathing, and gentle tapping can effectively activate the vagus nerve.
