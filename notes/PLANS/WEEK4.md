## Phase 4 Goal

> **“Fuse symmetry into strength. Prepare body to hypertrophy without dysfunction.”**

- Cement **left-right integration**
    
- Load full ROM safely under intra-rep breath control
    
- Amplify CNS through **rebound, throw, sprint, and fast lifts**
    
- Generate maximum **force without compensatory torque leaks**

## Core Principles for Phase 4

|System|Focus|Goal|
|---|---|---|
|Ribcage-Pelvis Timing|Maintain breath-mech under load|No rib flare, no hip shift|
|Scapular Freedom|Train rows/presses without winging|Restore full shoulder motion|
|Posterior Chain|Bilateral strength w/ exhale coordination|Glutes + hamstrings dominate|
|Sprint Mechanics|Fast force expression|Translate tension into speed|
|CNS Stimulation|Med-ball throws, pogo, bounds|Boost hormonal & neurological drive|

## 10-Hour Full-Day Plan (Phase 4: Days 25–30)

---

### BLOCK 1 (75–90 min): Neural Priming + Breathing Reset

- Wall Reach Rib Wraps (Left Posterior Expansion) – 3 x 5
    
- Seated Breath Ladder: Inhale 4s, Exhale 6–8s – 5 rounds
    
- Sidelying Open-Closed Chain (Right Down, Left Glute Active) – 3 x 6
    
- Pogo-to-Freeze (Controlled Stiffness Test) – 3 x 10
    
- Vagus Reset + Humming + Tactile Left Rib Tap – 10 mins
    

---

### BLOCK 2 (90–120 min): Strength + Hypertrophy Base

> First hypertrophy exposure using perfect structure

- Landmine Press + Row Combo (Scapula Driven) – 4 x 8
    
- DB Bulgarian Split Squats (Left Start) – 4 x 8–10
    
- Romanian Deadlifts (Posterior Chain to Midrange) – 4 x 8
    
- Med Ball Slam w/ Exhale (Split Stance) – 4 x 6
    
- Cable Cross Chop (Left-Low to Right-High) – 3 x 10
    

> _Focus: Keep exhaling on concentric, avoid rib elevation or pelvis shift._

---

### BLOCK 3 (75–90 min): Sprint + Plyometric Conversion

> Gait → Elastic → Reactive Force

- Sprint Drill Flow: March → Skip → Sprint (Focus Left Glute Push) – 4 rounds
    
- Banded Sprint Starts (Left Leg Drive Bias) – 4 x 10m
    
- Bound-Rebound Ladder (Distance + Height Focus) – 3 x 5
    
- Ankle Stiffness + Medial Arch Spring Training (Line Hops, Skips) – 4 rounds
    
- Sprint → Drop → Stop Drill (Anti-rotation Catch) – 4 x 10m
    

---

### BLOCK 4 (90–120 min): Full-Body Hypertrophy Mapping

> Strategic hypertrophy for symmetry + movement prep

- Front Squats w/ Breath Pauses at Bottom (3s Exhale) – 3 x 6
    
- Incline DB Press + Row Superset (Scapular Glide) – 3 x 10
    
- Ham Curl → Glute Bridge ISO Superset – 3 sets
    
- Lateral Step-Ups + Glute Med Band Walks – 3 x 10
    
- Medicine Ball Chest Pass → Sprint Start (CNS Sync) – 4 rounds
    

---

### BLOCK 5 (75–90 min): Tissue Recovery + Parasympathetic Shift

- Box Breathing: 4-4-4-4 – 10 min
    
- 90/90 Wall Rib Reset with Pelvic Lift – 4 x 6 breaths
    
- Barefoot Slow Gait + Cross Crawl (20 mins, nasal only)
    
- Humming + Left Rib Tactile Stim (Light Tap) – 10 min
    
- Legs-Up Wall + Breath Hold Drops – 5 min

## Key Movement Conversions

|Weakness → Reinforcement|Exercise|
|---|---|
|Left Glute Inactive → Glute Med ISO + Split Squats|✓|
|Rib Flare → Landmine + Wall Rib Wrap|✓|
|Gait Collapse → March + Sprint Ladder|✓|
|CNS Underdrive → Med Ball + Drop Catches|✓|
|Breath Control → Exhale Loading in All Lifts|✓|

## End-State Outcome After Phase 4

✅ Rib-Pelvis Symmetry Under Load  
✅ Sprint Mechanics Reactivated  
✅ Posterior Chain Hypertrophy Primed  
✅ CNS and Breath Coupled in All Movement  
✅ Ready for **split hypertrophy training** next month
