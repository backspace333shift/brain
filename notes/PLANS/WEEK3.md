## Phase 3 Objective

**Core Theme**: _“Train the corrected patterns under real-world demands.”_

- Turn symmetry into **strength**
    
- Reinforce left glute/ham + right eccentric brake systems
    
- Restore **spring mechanics**, sprint-ready energy
    
- Layer gait ↔ breath ↔ force ↔ posture into **one integrated system**

##  Phase 3: 10-Hour Full-Day Plan (Days 15–24)

---

### BLOCK 1 (60–75 min): **CNS Morning Prep + Positional Anchoring**

> Establish rib-pelvis-neutral, activate full chain under low intensity load

- Cross-Body Band Reach (Left Ham + Right Serratus Bias) – 3 sets x 6 breaths
    
- Wall-Press Dead Bug w/ Controlled Exhale – 3 x 6
    
- Heel-Elevated Split Squat ISO (Left Bias) – 3 x 20s hold each leg
    
- Left Glute Bridge + Right Arm Reach Across – 3 x 10
    
- Pogo Breaths (quick low amplitude hops + nasal 2:2 breathing) – 3 x 20
    

---

### BLOCK 2 (90–120 min): **Integrated Loading + Breath-Driven Strength**

> Controlled force application through cross-body + split stance loading

- Cross-Body Cable Lift (Low → High Left-to-Right) – 4 x 6
    
- Tempo Split Squats (3-1-3) w/ Exhale at Bottom – 4 x 6 each side
    
- Front Foot Elevated Stepback Lunge (Left Load Focus) – 3 x 8
    
- Half-Kneeling Anti-Rotation Press (Left Knee Up) – 3 x 10 each
    
- Left Glute Med Kick-Outs + ISO Hold (Band) – 3 x 10 + 20s
    

---

### BLOCK 3 (60–75 min): **Sprint Prep + Gait-Phase Drill Matrix**

> Build controlled speed mechanics, eccentric/elastic tolerance

- March → Skip → Bound Ladder (focus breath + strike timing) – 3 rounds
    
- Split-Stance Breathing w/ Left Reach → Exhale on Left Landing – 3 x 8
    
- High-Knee Tempo Drills + Nasal Pacing (4-4) – 4 x 20m
    
- Ankle Stiffness + Recoil Drill (Low Pogo Bounds) – 5 x 20s
    
- Cross-Crawl Run Simulation (Soft Grounding) – 4 x 10 steps
    

---

### BLOCK 4 (90–120 min): **Resisted Pattern Training + Asymmetry Rewiring**

> Chain-load asymmetries under control → transform into symmetric strength

- Contralateral RDL (DB in Right, Load Left Ham) – 3 x 8
    
- Landmine Rotation + Anti-Twist (Left Drive) – 3 x 10
    
- Lateral Step-Up to March (Hold Top for 3s, Left Bias) – 3 x 6
    
- Banded Sprint Wall Drives (Low Angle, Left Drive Cue) – 3 x 10 each
    
- Dynamic Dead Bug + Wall Push (Breath Control) – 3 x 10
    

---

### BLOCK 5 (75–90 min): **Evening Reset + Parasympathetic Lock-In**

> Unwind neural tone, reset tissue recoil, rebuild deep rib-pelvis rhythm

- Side-Lying Breath Expansion (Right Side Down) – 4 x 5 breaths
    
- Left Glute + Ham Squeeze ISO w/ Breath Hold – 3 x 6
    
- Humming, Vagus-Activated Reset + Light Compression (Left Rib Tap) – 10–15 min
    
- Slow Pacing Walks (Cross Pattern, Mouth Closed) – 20 min
    
- 90/90 Wall Rib Reset + Long Exhale – 4 min

## Strategic Layering Table

|System|Integration Target|
|---|---|
|Left Side Posterior Chain|Load + tempo control under upright movement|
|Right Side Dominance|Eccentric control & torque suppression|
|Gait Chain|March → skip → bound → sprint prep|
|Core-Rib-Pelvis Timing|Exhale-inhale coordination under force cycles|
|CNS Stimulation|Sprint rebound → skip → anti-rotation → pogo|

## Results by End of Phase 3

- Gait-symmetry loaded and sprint-pattern ready
    
- Visible left-side control and glute-drive in movement
    
- Posterior chain drive re-integrated
    
- Neurologically safe and primed for hypertrophy under bilateral lifts
    
- Significant reduction in asymmetry-related tension/stiffness
